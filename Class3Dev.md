# Class-less Inter Domain Routing - CIDR #
> Classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) is a set of Internet protocol (IP) standards that is used to create unique identifiers for networks and individual devices. The IP addresses allow particular information packets to be sent to specific computers. Shortly after the introduction of CIDR, technicians found it difficult to track and label IP addresses, so a notation system was developed to make the process more efficient and standardized. That system is known as CIDR notation.

>CIDR IP addresses consist of two groups of numbers, which are also referred to as groups of bits. The most important of these groups is the network address, and it is used to identify a network or a sub-network (subnet). The lesser of the bit groups is the host identifier. The host identifier is used to determine which host or device on the network should receive incoming information packets. In contrast to classful routing, which categorizes addresses into one of three blocks, CIDR allows for blocks of IP addresses to be allocated to Internet service providers. The blocks are then split up and assigned to the providerâ€™s customers. Until recently, IP addresses used the IPv4 CIDR standard, but because IPv4 addresses are nearly exhausted, a new standard known as IPv6 has been developed and will soon be implemented.

# CIDR Calculation #
>CIDR blocks share the first part of the bit sequence that comprises the binary representation of the IP address, and blocks are identified using the same decimal-dot CIDR notation system that is used for IPv4 addresses. For example, 10.10.1.16/32 is an address prefix with 32 bits, which is the highest number of bits allowed in IPv4. Addresses with identical prefixes and the same number of bits always belong to the same block. In addition, larger blocks can be easily distinguished from smaller blocks by the length of the prefix. Short prefixes allow for more addresses while large prefixes identify small blocks.
>CIDR notation is also used for the newer IPv6 standard, and the syntax is the same. The only difference is that IPv6 addresses may contain up to 128 bits instead of the 32-bit maximum of IPv4

**The formula to calculate the number of assignable IP address to CIDR networks is similar to classful networking. Subtract the number of network bits from 32. Raise 2 to that power and subtract 2 for the network and broadcast addresses. For example, a /24 network has 232-24 - 2 addresses available for host assignment.**
